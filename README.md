- 👋 Hi, I’m Juliana Meirelles and I just finished my masters degree in Data Science.
- 👀 I’m fascinated by the link between individuals and their environment, and how we can use data to explore & communicate critical information to improve this link. 
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in R, Python, Machine Learning, and more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to work for a organization that values community-led change & climate action (especially in the area of permaculture and carbon sequestration!)
